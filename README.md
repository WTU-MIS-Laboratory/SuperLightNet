## Release

-  ðŸ”¥**News**: ```2025/3/2```: SuperLightNet released.


## Introduction to SuperLightNet

SuperLightNet is an ultra-lightweight multimodal framework for brain tumor segmentation, employing a parameter-efficient architecture with only 2.97 million parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our network demonstrates a leading reduction in parameter count by 95.59\% (2.97M), the 96.78\% improvement in computational efficiency (0.282 TFlops), the 96.86\% enhancement in memory access performance (45.8G), and an average performance gain of 0.21\% on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2021 datasets.
